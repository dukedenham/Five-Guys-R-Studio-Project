# Five-Guys-R-Studio-Project

This is a project done in R studio where I created a report for the fast casual burger restaurant Five Guys. I used two data sets from SafeGraph that focus on daily visits in July 2020 that different brands from various different industries received in the King County of Washington. From this data, I analyzed the state of Five Guys' visits and compared it to its' competitors to see what could possibly increase the daily visits to Five Guys. I looked at the difference between weekday and weekend visits, the frequency distribution of visits, and where in King County these visitors were coming from. From this, I made suggestions on how Five Guys could increase its' average daily visitors based on how the company's performance compared to competitors in these areas. I used ggplot to visualize these findings and illustrate the differences in activity.
