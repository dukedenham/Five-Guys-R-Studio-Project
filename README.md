# Five-Guys-R-Studio-Project

This is a project done in R studio on the fast casual burger restaurant Five Guys. I used two data sets from SafeGraph that focus on daily visits that different brands in various different industries received in the King County of Washington during July of 2020. From this data, I analyzed the state of Five Guys' visits and compared it to its' competitors to see what could possibly increase the daily visits to Five Guys. I looked at the difference between weekday and weekend visits, the frequency distribution of visits, and where in King County these visitors were coming from. I made suggestions on how Five Guys could increase its' average daily visitors based on how the company's performance compared to competitors. I used ggplot to visualize these findings and illustrate the differences in activity.
