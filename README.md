# Five-Guys-R-Studio-Project

This is a project done in R studio on the fast casual burger restaurant chain Five Guys. I used two data sets from SafeGraph that focus on daily visits to different brands from various different industries in the King County of Washington for July 2020. From this data, I analyzed the state of the company's visits and created a report where I compared Five Guys to its' competitors to see what could possibly increase the daily visits to Five Guys. I looked at the difference between weekday and weekend visits, the frequency distribution of visits, and where in King County these visitors were coming from. From this, I made suggestions on how Five Guys could increase its' average daily visitors based on how the company's performance compared to competitors in these areas. I used ggplot to visualize these findings and illustrate the differences in activity.
